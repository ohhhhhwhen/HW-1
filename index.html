                Hi, my name is Owen Chanthala. I lived and studied in San Diego, California. I love
                sports, arts, anime, and fashion. Concerning sports, my favorite teams are the Chargers,
                Lakers, and Padres. No offense to my new home but, like my cousins, whom I am living
                with, we dislike all Seattle teams and don't care about the Seahawks. Anyways, I enjoy
                going to art museums. Observing famous and local artists. With the arts, I am very fond the
                artwork and creativity of anime and fashion. From vintage, current trends and high end.
                Before coming to Seattle, I would sell various items from my closet, that I either
                purchased at some point or thrifted somewhere.
            </p>

            <p>
                Back home I was studying computer science and working on code myself. I moved out to
                Seattle at the end of October, living in Lacey, which is about an hour away from the
                city, depending on traffic. I moved here to attend the coding boot camp and possibly
                find a career out here. I can dream, but soon, I would like to work for Microsoft. If
                that doesn't pan out right away, I wouldn't mind finding a local tech company to pursue
                my work in coding.
